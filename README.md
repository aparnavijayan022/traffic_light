# traffic_light
A simple Python command-line program that simulates traffic light behavior. It takes a light color as input and prints the appropriate action (stop, go, look), helping beginners understand conditional statements (if, elif, else) in Python.This project demonstrates basic control flow in Python using a real-world example: traffic lights.
